## Code of conduct
### Collaboration
By using communications channels such as discord to communicate daily, ask questions or discuss topics regarding the task. Make sure that everyone understands the task at hand and divide the work if possible, or work together in pairwise programming. Not being able to attend to a meeting has to be informed to the group beforehand
We will make use of tools inside gitlab to create issues that we can assign ourselves to and assign other members for code reviews.

### Individual contributions
we will have stand-ups (at least twice per week) to let each other know about what we have done and what we plan to do, we will be communicating through our discord channel daily as well.

### Knowledge and understanding
During our weekly meeting we will talk about what has been done, and explain the code if not self explanatory or if there are no requests about explaining parts of the code. The knowledge transfer between team members does not necessarily require all team members to be present. This has to be communicated if e.g someone already has the knowledge, cannot attend a planned meeting etc.

### Communication
We are going to use discord as our main communication channel where we will be active every day. We will use a meeting agenda to follow some structure during our meetings. A short summary will be provided by the person responsible for the meeting a given week, this will be iterated and changed every week so a new person is responsible for the meeting agenda.
With the following iteration: Eric, David, Samuel, Martin.
Tuesday 8-9 Standup 10 min, Planning 50 min
Thursday 8-9 Standup 10 min, Planning 40 min, Group Feedback 10 min.
Friday 8-9 (optional)

### Conflicts within the team
Conflicts regarding tasks where there are different sets of opinions we will have a mandatory vote. If and only if it is a draw then the meeting facilitator will count as two votes, then the total amount of votes will be five (the facilitator can only vote for one option).
Issues within the team will be discussed, if someone does not contribute, laze around, does not communicate etc. If the issue does not get solved we will let our ta or lecturer in on the issue, to act as a mediator.

On thursdays meetings, every member of the group will give feeback about the groups enviroment and work progess.
Also clarify expecations to avoid future conflicts.
